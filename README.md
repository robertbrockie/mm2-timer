## About
In my free time I like to try and finish Mega Man 2 as fast as possible. This is a simple app that allows me to keep track of my runs. You can check it out live [here](https://mm2.robertbrockie.com).


## Running Locally

The application is built on [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) w/ [Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/). So to run this app locally just clone and ...

`> npm install && npm start`
